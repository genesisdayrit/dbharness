# Database Context

This directory contains LLM-friendly schema context files generated by `dbharness schemas`.

## Structure

After running `dbharness schemas`, the following structure is created for each connection:

```
context/
  <connection-name>/
    schemas.yml                          # Overview of all schemas in the database
    schemas/
      <schema-name>/
        tables.yml                       # All tables and views in this schema
```

## How to use (for LLMs / AI agents)

1. Start with `schemas.yml` to see which schemas exist and how many tables each contains
2. Navigate into `schemas/<schema-name>/tables.yml` for detailed table listings
3. Use the `description` fields (when populated) for additional context about what each schema or table contains

## Generating context files

```bash
# Use the primary connection
dbharness schemas

# Use a specific connection
dbharness schemas -s my-connection
```

Re-running the command overwrites existing context files with fresh data from the database.
