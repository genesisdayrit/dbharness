# Database Context

This directory contains LLM-friendly schema context files generated by `dbh schemas`.

## Structure

After running `dbh schemas`, the following structure is created for each connection:

```
context/
  connections/
    <connection-name>/
      databases/
        _databases.yml                   # List of databases in this connection
        <database-name>/
          schemas/
            _schemas.yml                 # Overview of all schemas in the database
            <schema-name>/
              _tables.yml                # All tables and views in this schema
```

## How to use (for LLMs / AI agents)

1. Start with `_databases.yml` to see which databases exist under this connection
2. Navigate into `<database>/schemas/_schemas.yml` to see which schemas exist and how many tables each contains
3. Navigate into `<schema>/_tables.yml` for detailed table listings
4. Use the `description` fields (when populated) for additional context about what each schema or table contains

## Generating context files

```bash
# Use the primary connection
dbh schemas

# Use a specific connection
dbh schemas -s my-connection
```

Re-running the command overwrites existing context files with fresh data from the database.
